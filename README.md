# TeaStore v2 (HTTP/1.1 | HTTP/2 | HTTP/3) #  

TeaStore v2 is a rework of the original [TeaStore](https://se.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/software-engineering-group/tools/teastore/) and part of my master thesis.  
The original version was developed by the Descartes Research Group (University of WÃ¼rzburg).  
TeaStore emulates a basic web store for automatically generated, tea and tea supplies.   
For more details visit the base [repository](https://github.com/DescartesResearch/TeaStore).

## Changes (WIP)
- Registry replaced with [Traefik](https://github.com/traefik/traefik), a HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer
- Netty HTTP servers (and client) instead of Jetty servlets
- Support for HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3
- Full JSON-API instead of JSPs
- Optimized API paths
- The database setup includes the data population
- Java 17 (LTS) as target environment

## Getting Started
